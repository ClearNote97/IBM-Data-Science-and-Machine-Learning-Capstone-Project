# IBM-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Capstone-Project

## Introduction
Space X, the visionary aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, revolutionized the space industry with its Falcon 9 rocket launches. They achieve remarkable cost savings by reusing the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket. The ability to predict the success of the first stage landing can significantly impact cost estimates for space missions and competitive bidding in the space launch market.

This project aims to create a machine learning pipeline that predicts whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. We will leverage data science techniques, from data gathering with web scraping to exploratory data analysis and building predictive models, to gain insights into this critical aspect of space exploration.

## Project Overview
* We start by gathering data related to Falcon 9 launches using web scraping techniques to obtain relevant information from Space X's website and other reliable sources.
* After collecting the data, we perform exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns and characteristics of successful and unsuccessful landings. Visualizations will help us gain insights and inform feature engineering decisions.
* Data preprocessing is a crucial step where we clean, transform, and standardize the data, preparing it for the machine learning models.
* Next, we design a machine learning pipeline that includes various algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression, to predict the first stage landing outcome.
* To find the best hyperparameters and improve model performance, we perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like cross-validation.
* Finally, we evaluate the predictive models on test data to determine the most accurate and reliable method for predicting first stage landings.

## Data Collection
Data collection is a critical phase in any data science project. We leverage web scraping techniques to gather information related to Falcon 9 launches, including performance data, landing outcomes, and other relevant features. This data is essential for building our predictive model.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this stage, we dive into the collected data, visualize key statistics, and explore relationships between variables. We examine patterns in successful and unsuccessful landings to uncover insights that will guide us in feature engineering and model selection.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming features to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms. Standardizing the data is essential to ensure that all features contribute equally to the predictive model.

## Machine Learning Pipeline
With the preprocessed data, we build a machine learning pipeline that includes multiple algorithms. We will implement Support Vector Machines, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression to predict the outcome of Falcon 9 first stage landings.

## Model Evaluation
Model evaluation is a crucial step to select the most accurate and reliable predictive model. We use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of each model. Cross-validation is applied to ensure robustness and avoid overfitting.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the power of data science in predicting Falcon 9 first stage landings. By leveraging web scraping, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning techniques, we achieve valuable insights into space exploration and cost estimation.

The results of this project can contribute to competitive bidding in the space launch market and support decision-making in space missions.
